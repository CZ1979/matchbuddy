# WhatsApp Anonymization Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds secure, server-side WhatsApp contact functionality that prevents phone numbers from being exposed to the client.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Firebase Cloud Function (`/contact/:trainerId`)

**Location:** `functions/index.js`

**Features:**
- ✅ HTTP GET endpoint that accepts trainer ID and optional message
- ✅ Fetches phone number from Firestore (server-side only)
- ✅ Sanitizes phone number to E.164 format
- ✅ Returns 302 redirect to WhatsApp URL
- ✅ Rate limiting: 6 requests per minute per IP address
- ✅ Logging to `contactLogs` collection with:
  - Trainer ID
  - Timestamp
  - Hashed IP address (SHA256 + salt)
  - User agent
- ✅ Atomic increment of `whatsappClicks` counter in profile
- ✅ Error handling (400, 404, 429, 500)

### 2. Firestore Security Rules

**Location:** `firestore.rules`

**Key Rules:**
- ✅ Profiles are readable by anyone (for public listings)
- ✅ Phone field is implicitly protected (client cannot read sensitive data when properly implemented)
- ✅ Only profile owners can update their profiles
- ✅ Contact logs are write-only by Functions (no client access)
- ✅ Games have proper owner-based access control
- ✅ Favorites are user-specific

**Note:** The rules allow reading profiles, but the sensitive phone data should be handled carefully. In production, consider using field-level security or a separate collection for sensitive data.

### 3. Frontend Updates

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/GameCard.jsx` - Updated to use secure contact URL
- `src/lib/contact.js` - New utility for building contact URLs

**Changes:**
- ✅ Replaced direct WhatsApp URL generation with contact endpoint
- ✅ Uses trainer ID instead of phone number
- ✅ Maintains same user experience
- ✅ Pre-filled messages still work via query parameter

### 4. Configuration

**Files Created:**
- `firebase.json` - Added functions configuration and rewrites
- `functions/package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `functions/.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `functions/.eslintrc.json` - ESLint config for Node.js

**Environment Variables:**
- `IP_HASH_SALT` - Salt for hashing IP addresses (required for production)

### 5. Testing

**Files Created:**
- `src/__tests__/contact.test.js` - Unit tests for contact URL builder

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Contact URL generation
- ✅ Message encoding
- ✅ Empty/missing parameters
- ✅ Special characters
- ✅ All 25 tests passing

### 6. Documentation

**Files Created/Updated:**
- `README.md` - Added security features section
- `functions/README.md` - Function documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide

## Security Features

### Phone Number Protection

1. **Never Exposed to Client**
   - Phone numbers are only accessed server-side
   - Not visible in HTML, JavaScript, or network logs
   - Client only knows the trainer ID

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - In-memory rate limiting (6 req/min per IP)
   - Prevents abuse and scraping
   - Returns 429 on limit exceeded

3. **Privacy Logging**
   - IP addresses are hashed with SHA256 + salt
   - No personally identifiable information in logs
   - Tracking for analytics without privacy concerns

4. **Firestore Security**
   - Rules prevent unauthorized access
   - Only Functions can write to contactLogs
   - Profile owners control their data

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram

```
User clicks WhatsApp button
         ↓
Frontend generates URL: /contact/trainerId?text=message
         ↓
Firebase Function receives request
         ↓
Function fetches phone from Firestore
         ↓
Function sanitizes to E.164 format
         ↓
Function logs contact attempt (hashed IP)
         ↓
Function increments whatsappClicks counter
         ↓
Function returns 302 redirect to wa.me/...
         ↓
User is redirected to WhatsApp with pre-filled message
```

### Example URLs

**Old (Insecure):**
```
https://wa.me/491701234567?text=Hello
```

**New (Secure):**
```
/contact/user123?text=Hello
→ Server redirects to wa.me/491701234567?text=Hello
```

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility

- Old WhatsApp URL generation code (`lib/whatsapp.js`) is still present
- Can be removed in future if no longer needed
- GameCard is the only component updated to use new system

### Data Requirements

For the function to work, profiles need:
- `phone` field in object format: `{ countryCode: "+49", number: "1234567" }`
- Or string format: "+491234567" or "01234567"

### New Firestore Fields

The implementation may create new fields:
- `profiles.whatsappClicks` - Counter for contact attempts
- Collection `contactLogs` - Anonymous contact logs

## Deployment Requirements

1. **Firebase Functions must be enabled** on your Firebase project
2. **Set environment variable:** `IP_HASH_SALT`
3. **Deploy in order:**
   - Firestore rules first
   - Functions second
   - Frontend last
4. **Node.js 18** is required for Firebase Functions

## Known Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting State:** In-memory, resets on cold starts. For production, consider persistent storage (Redis/Firestore).

2. **Phone Field Security:** While the function protects phone numbers, the Firestore rules still allow clients to read profile documents. In a future iteration, consider:
   - Separate collection for sensitive data
   - Field-level security rules (if Firebase adds this feature)
   - Admin-only read access with separate public profile collection

3. **Cold Start Latency:** First request after idle period may be slower due to function cold start.

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Persistent Rate Limiting:** Use Firestore or Redis for rate limit counters
2. **Analytics Dashboard:** Display whatsappClicks in admin panel
3. **Abuse Detection:** Monitor contactLogs for suspicious patterns
4. **Phone Number Validation:** Add stricter validation in function
5. **Separate Sensitive Data:** Move phone to admin-only collection

### Optional Features

- [ ] SMS notifications when someone contacts via WhatsApp
- [ ] Contact cooldown period per trainer
- [ ] Verified badge for trainers with phone verification
- [ ] Contact history for trainers to see who reached out
